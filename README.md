Since the assignments and sections of 2022 winter use the Stanford library of version 2021, you should unzip the CS106_21.zip and run  Library project, which will set up the Stanford library of version 2021. However, test unit,i.e `simpleTest.h`, has not incorported into Stanford Library until the version of 2023, so if you want to write some tests based on test unit, you should unzip CS106_Modified_23.zip and run Library project. Here, 'Modified' means it is not the original CS106.zip provided by Stanford, I have modified some contents of Library.pro to switch the location of Stanford library of version 2023 and prevent overriding the one of version 2021.

Unzip BlankProject.zip, you will see three project templates in there: BlankProject_21, BlankProject_Modified_23 and BlankProject_Origin_23. BlankProject_21 corresponds to CS106_21.zip, BlankProject_Modified_23 to CS106_Modified_23.zip and  BlankProject_Origin_23 to the original CS106.zip of version 2023.
